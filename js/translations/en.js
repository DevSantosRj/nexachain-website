  "tech_heading": "Hybrid Consensus PoW + RPCA",
  "tech_text": "NEXACHAIN uses a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines the best of both worlds: the decentralization of Proof of Work (PoW) with the efficiency of the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA).",
  "tech_card1_title": "Proof of Work (PoW)",
  "tech_card1_text": "Any node can mine blocks by solving a SHA-256 challenge, ensuring Bitcoin-style decentralization. Difficulty is dynamically adjusted to maintain blocks every ~3-5 seconds.",
  "tech_card2_title": "Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA)",
  "tech_card2_text": "Trusted validators verify block proposals, ensuring fast consensus without forks. The validator list is open, allowing nodes with reputation to join.",
  "tech_card3_title": "Energy Efficiency",
  "tech_card3_text": "PoW is used only to propose blocks, not for full validation, reducing energy consumption compared to Bitcoin (~0.1-1 TWh/year estimated for 1000 nodes vs. 150 TWh/year for BTC).",

  "tokenomics_halving_title": "Reward Halvings",
  "tokenomics_halving_text": "Initial reward: 10 NEX per block. Halving every 1 year: 10 NEX → 5 NEX → 2.5 NEX, etc.",
  "tokenomics_additional_title": "Additional Burning",
  "tokenomics_additional_text": "0.1% of DEX transaction value is burned. NFT creation and smart contract execution may include optional burning.",
  "tokenomics_projection_title": "Supply Projection",
  "tokenomics_projection_text": "After approximately 4 years (2 halvings), burning should exceed issuance, making NEX deflationary.",
